          This document proposes allocating a dedicated IPv4 address for translating arbitrary (non-IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses
and suggests the creation of an ICMP Multi-part Extension
          to carry the original IPv6 source address of ICMPv6 messages
          translated to ICMP by stateless (RFC7915) or stateful (RFC 6146) protocol translators.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
To allow communication between IPv6-only and IPv4-only devices, IPv4/IPv6 translators translate IPv6 and IPv4 packet headers according to the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC7915"/>.
For example, 464XLAT (<xref target="RFC6877"/>) defines an architecture for providing IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only network. The solution contains two key elements: provider-side translator (PLAT) and customer-side translator (CLAT). CLAT implementations translate private IPv4 addresses to global IPv6 addresses, and vice versa, as defined in <xref target="RFC7915"/>. 
</t>
<t>

To map IPv4 addresses to IPv6 ones the translators use the translation prefix (either a well-known or a network-specific one, see <xref target="RFC6052"/>). The resulting IPv6 addresses can be statelessly translated back to IPv4.
However it's not the case for an arbitrary global IPv6 addresses. Those addresses can only be translated to IPv4 by a stateful translators.
</t>
<t>
One of scenarios when it might be required but not currently possible is translating ICMPv6 error messages send by intermediate nodes to the CLAT address in the 464XLAT envinronment. The most typical example is a diagnistic tool like traceroute sending packets to an IPv4 destination from an IPv6-only host.
Received ICMPv6 Time Exceeded are translated to ICMP Time Exceeded. If those packets were originated from an IPv4 address and translated to ICMPv6 by the PLAT (NAT64) device, then the source address of such packet can be mapped back to IPv4 by removing the translation prefix. However ICMPv6 error messages sent by devices located between the IPv6-only host and the NAT64 device have "native" IPv6 source addresses, which can not be mapped back to IPv4.
Those packets are usually dropped and tools like traceroute can not represent IPv6 intermediate hops in any meaningful way. Such behaviour complicates troubleshooting. It's also confusing for users and increases operational costs, as users report packet loss in the network based on traceroute output.
</t>
      <t>
Some CLAT implementations are known to workaround this issue by representing IPv6 addresses in IPv4 traceroute by using a reserved IPv4 address space and using the hop limit as the last octet, so an IPv6 device 5 hops away is shown as 225.0.0.5 etc.
      </t>
<t>
It should be noted that the similar issue occurs in IPv6 Data Center Environments when an ICMPv6 error message needs to be sent to an IPv4-only client.
As per Section 4.8 of <xref target="RFC7755"/>, ICMPv6 error packets are usually dropped by the translator.
</t>
<t>
This document introduces a dedicated IPv4 address to translate arbitrary global IPv6 addresses in ICMPv6 error messages, and proposes an ICMP extension so original IPv6 address of an ICMPv6 error message can be included into IMCP message and therefore passed to an application.

          Whenever a translator translates an ICMPv4 (<xref target="RFC0792"/>) packet from an ICMPv6 (<xref target="RFC4443"/>) one,
          and the IPv6 source address in the outermost IPv6 header does not match the NAT64
          prefix (and is therefore not mappable to an IPv4 address), the translator SHOULD:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
<t>
Append an extension object (<xref target="RFC4884"/>) described in this document to the ICMPv6 packet before translation.
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
Perform stateful translation of the IPv6 source address to 192.0.0.11.
</t>
</li>
</ul>
      <t>
          The translator SHOULD NOT use 192.0.0.11/32 to translate the source IPv6 address and SHOULD NOT add the extension if the packet IPv6 source address
is an IPv4 address mapped to an IPv6 address using the translation prefix known to the translator, of if the translator has a stateful entry for the given IPv6 address mapped to another IPv4 address.

When adding the new Extension Structure, the translator MUST:

Create a new ICMP Extension Structure, containing one Extension Header and one IPv6 Original Source Extension object.

Set the length field of the ICMPv6 message to the length of the padded "original datagram" field, measured in 32-bit words.

Adding IPv6 Original Source Extension Object to Existing ICMP Extension Structure

If the original ICMPv6 message already contains an ICMP Extension Structure,  the translator SHOULD append an IPv6 Original Source Extension object to that structure.
When appending the object, the translator MUST:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
<t>
Append  an IPv6 Original Source Extension object to the Extension Structure.
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
Update the checksum field of the Extension Header accordingly.
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
If the resulting packet size exceeds the minimum IPv6 MTU: truncate the embedded invoking packet by removing the trailing 20 octets (to accomodate for 20 octets of the extension object) and update the length field of the ICMPv6 message

<section>
<name>Translating Arbitrary IPv6 Source Addresses Using the Dedicated IPv4 Address</name>
<t>
The translator SHOULD use the dedicated IPv4 192.0.0.11/32 for translating IPv6 source addresses if all of the following conditions are met:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
<t>
The packet being translated is one of the following:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
<t>
ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
ICMPv6 Packet Too Big
</t>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<t>
the IPv6 source address in the outermost IPv6 header does not match the NAT64 prefix (and is therefore not mappable to an IPv4 address).
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
The translator does not have an explicit address mapping (<xref target="RFC7757"/>) configured for the given global IPv6 address to an IPv4 address .
</t>
</li>
</ul>

<t>
it should be noted that the IPv6 Original Source Extension Object can not be added to ICMPv6 Packet Too Big messages (see Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC4884"/>). 
At the same time it's highly desirable to ensure that translators translate those messages even if the IPv6 source address in the outermost IPv6 header does not match the NAT64 prefix (and is therefore not mappable to an IPv4 address), as those messages are crucial for Path MTU Discovery.
